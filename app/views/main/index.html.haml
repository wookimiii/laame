  %p I just realized Christmas is just 9 days away and I haven't done any shopping! But that's not the purpose of Christmas anyways. I love Christmas because even though its a crazy busy time of year, its the time to truly reflect on the birth of Jesus Christ. Thinking of how Jesus loved a sinner such as me so much that He gave up His position as God in heaven to come to earth. It's really amazing. God loves us so much He gave His son! There's nothing more wonderful than that. Christmas is really about John 3:16. Thank you Lord.
  
  %p Philippians 2:6-8 who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
  %p And for those like who haven't done your, here's a joke to remind you to choose your gifts wisely 
  %h2 Joke of the day
  %p Three sons left home, went out on their own and prospered. Getting together for Christmas, they discussed the gifts they were able to give their elderly mother. 
  %p The first said, “I built a big house for our mother.” 
  %p The second said, “I sent her a Mercedes.” 
  %p The third smiled and said, “I’ve got you both beat. You remember how mom enjoyed reading the Bible? And you know she can’t see very well. So I sent her a remarkable parrot that recites the entire Bible. It took elders in the church 12 years to teach him. He’s one of a kind. Mom just has to name the chapter and verse, and the parrot recites it.” 
  %p Soon thereafter, mom sent out her letters of thanks: 
  %p “Dear Milton,” she wrote one son, “The house you built is too huge. I live in only one room, but I have to keep the whole house clean!” 
  %p “Dear Gerald,” she wrote to another, “I am too old to travel. I stay at home most of the time, so I rarely use the Mercedes.” 
  %p “Dearest Donald,” she wrote to her third son, “You have the good sense to know what your Mother likes. 
  The chicken was Dee-licious!”

  %h2 Joke of the day
  %p
    There once was a rich man who was near death. He was very grieved because he had worked so hard for his money and he wanted to be able to take it with him to heaven. So he began to pray that he might be able to take some of his wealth with him. 
  %p
    An angel hears his plea and appears to him. "Sorry, but you can't take your wealth with you." The man implores the angel to speak to God to see if He might bend the rules.   
  %p
    The man continues to pray that his wealth could follow him. The angel reappears and informs the man that God has decided to allow him to take one suitcase with him. Overjoyed, the man gathers his largest suitcase and fills it with pure gold bars and places it beside his bed. 
  
  %p
    Soon afterward the man dies and shows up at the Gates of Heaven to greet St. Peter. St. Peter seeing the suitcase says, "Hold on, you can't bring that in here!" 
  
  %p
    But, the man explains to St. Peter that he has permission and asks him to verify his story with the Lord. Sure enough, St. Peter checks and comes back saying, "You're right. You are allowed one carry-on bag, but I'm supposed to check its contents before letting it through." 
  
  %p
    St. Peter opens the suitcase to inspect the worldly items that the man found too precious to leave behind and exclaims, "You brought pavement?!!!"
